Math game for kids 

Welcome to Mathgame. This is a beginner python program, that is also a game for kids to practice basic mathematics operations.

At the begining you will be asked to insert your name and the difficulty level. Once you select a level it will give you a basic math operation and you will be demanded to insert the result.

In level 1, only addition and substraction with numbers between 0 and 10 are allowed, and in case operation is substract, the first number will always be lower than the first, so the result is always positive.
In level 2, addition and substraction allow numbers between -100 and 100. Multiplication operation is added with numbers between -10 and 10.
In level 3, division is added, and operations allow bigger numbers. 

Have in mind that division operation expects an integer result. For exaple, if the operation is 31/10, you should enter 3.
